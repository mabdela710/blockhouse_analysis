# Blockhouse Market Impact & Optimal Allocation Project

This project analyzes temporary market impact and formulates an optimal order allocation algorithm. It aims to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, mathematical modeling, and clear communication of complex financial concepts.

## Project Structure

- `blockhouse_analysis.py`: Main Python script for data loading, impact modeling, and optimal execution.
- `impact_modeling_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed analysis and visualizations.
- `data/`: Contains raw and extracted market data for CRWV, FROG, and SOUN tickers.
- `output/`: Stores generated plots and analysis results.
- `docs/`: Contains the HTML report and supplementary PDF documents.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing**: Handles loading and preprocessing of market data from various formats.
- **Temporary Impact Modeling**: Implements linear and non-linear (power-law) models for temporary market impact `g_t(x)`.
- **Optimal Order Allocation**: Provides a mathematical framework and algorithm to determine optimal order allocation (`x_i`) over time intervals (`t_i`) to minimize trading costs, ensuring `Î£x_i = S` (total shares).
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful plots to visualize impact models and optimal allocation strategies.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed explanations in PDF format and an interactive HTML report.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd blockhouse_analysis-main
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy notebook nbconvert
    ```
3.  **Run the analysis script:**
    ```bash
    python blockhouse_analysis.py
    ```
    This script will process data, fit models, and generate output plots in the `output/` directory.

4.  **View the detailed analysis (Jupyter Notebook):**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook impact_modeling_analysis.ipynb
    ```
    You can also view the HTML version directly:
    `docs/impact_modeling_analysis_output.html`

5.  **Access Reports and Visualizations:**
    Open `docs/index.html` in your web browser to navigate through the analysis report, plots, and supplementary documents.
